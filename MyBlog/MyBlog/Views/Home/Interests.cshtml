Love it or hate it, I'm on the side of the fence where I love it. I have a custom gaming PC running Windows 7 that I've built as well as an iPad, 
15" Macbook Pro, and a Samsung Galaxy S4. I don't hate any one company just because they are a specific brand because I love technology too much.

I've been a C# developer for about 2 years now and I really enjoy it. I've started out with VB.net but that language quickly grew tiredsome. That's when I turned to C# and started developing asp.net webform and windows form applications. Eventually I've branched out to MVC and here I am today. 
I want to eventually learn other technologies as well such as Ruby on Rails and objective c for iPhone application development. After I get very comfortable with MVC, I will move onto Ruby on Rails.

The first database I've learned and used was the Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2. I've designed the tables using manual scripts to create the tables and setting the table's referencial integrities. It is a nice relational database
management system.

Although at work we use Microsoft SQL Server, we also use MySql database management system. I picked it up right away and it was a breeze to use. This actually became my preferred database management system out of the two.

Another technology that I use especially with this website is Github. At work, I use Subversion and Github pretty much works in the same way as Subversion does but from the cloud. It is one of the most useful tools to save your projects and to share as well. I'm still only a beginner 
with Github with committing to only the master project (no branches) as I only develop this site myself without a team. It would be interesting to use it with a team in the future to utilize Github to the fullest.
